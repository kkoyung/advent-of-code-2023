# Advent of Code 2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles released every December by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).
This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Two puzzles are posted each day in the Advent calendar.
The solution to each puzzle is placed in a separate subdirectory.
For example, the first puzzle of day 2 is placed in `day02a` and the second puzzle of day2 is placed in `day02b`.

I chose Rust as the programming language to write my solutions to improve my Rust skills.
In some of the codes, functional programming features were used extensively.
I was intended to do this to force myself to become familiar with them.

If you find that the code doesn't work, or you'd like to discuss the code with me, feel free to open an issue in this GitHub repository or send me an email (kingsley@kkoyung.dev).
